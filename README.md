# Portfolio Website
* This is a repo for the [React](https://reactjs.org/) front-end of my portfolio website. 
* For the back-end, please see my repo [Portfolio-Website-Back-End](https://github.com/pierrebeasley/Portfolio-Website-Back-End)

## Framework and Libraries
* [React](https://reactjs.org/): *Interactive*
* [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/): *Responsive*
* [three.js](https://threejs.org/): *Landing Page 3D Model*

## Continuous Deployment
* This repo is linked to [Buddy.Works](https://app.buddy.works/) pipelines. 
* On every push to this repo from my local development IDE ([PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/)), [Buddy.Works](https://app.buddy.works/) builds the project files and upload the built files to the [AWS S3 Bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). 

## Full-Stack System
* This front-end requests information from a PHP server, which furthers feeds back information from a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) Database. 
* Keeps front-end independent of the type and amount of information.
